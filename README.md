# dollar-system-deception
The dollar system works because companies around the world are dumb enough to borrow in $ when the economy is good. Then when there is a recession, there is too much debt payable in $ and not enough actual $ to pay all that debt, so the value of $ goes up. Just look at [foreign] real estate companies like [] that borrow in USD but have revenue primarily in [local fiat domestic currency]. This sort of corporate finance retardation is what allows the US to plunder the world economy. If companies stopped taking currency risk just to save a few % in interest rate costs, they wouldn't be double screwed everytime there is a global recession and the value of their dollar debt goes up They think real estate price appreciation is going to bail them out.
