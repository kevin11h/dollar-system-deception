The dollar system works because companies around the world are dumb enough to borrow in $ when the economy is good. Then when there is a recession, there is too much debt payable in $ and not enough actual $ to pay all that debt, so the value of $ goes up. Just look at [foreign] real estate companies like [] that borrow in USD but have revenue primarily in [local fiat domestic currency]. This sort of corporate finance retardation is what allows the US to plunder the world economy. If companies stopped taking currency risk just to save a few % in interest rate costs, they wouldn't be double screwed everytime there is a global recession and the value of their dollar debt goes up They think real estate price appreciation is going to bail them out.

  Ever wonder why the first lesson in Rich Dad poor dad is the rich don’t work for money?     It’s because the dollar (or any fiat money) is a scam…     Rich Dad Scam #9: “The dollar has value.”     I can hear your doubt, or confusion. Let me explain…     Most people will tell you that the dollar is a tool of exchange. They are, of course, right in one respect. But if it only has value when it is being used or exchanged, it really is not money – it’s currency.     Currency must flow, just like a current (hence the name). It does not have actual value; it merely represents value.     The paper that is used to print a dollar on is not actually worth a dollar. The paper does not have the value, it simply represents the value. It is not money because it holds no individual value.     To take it a step further, dollars are actually the OPPOSITE of value. Dollars are debt.     A dollar is a PROMISE to pay back debt.     The U.S. is over a trillion dollars in debt. A trillion is “1” followed by 12 zeroes. It’s a thousand billion. A trillion seconds is 32,000 years. A stack of $1 bills would be 68,000 miles high. So how do we pay back such monumental debt?     Taxes. It’s painful, but it’s obvious.     So, the dollar is the PROMISE of the U.S. government to pay back over a trillion dollars of debt through taxing its citizens. And, to kick you while you are down, the debt is still growing.     The dollar is actually debt.     That is why the rich don’t work for dollars. They work for assets.     Beware of the scam artists,  Robert Kiyosaki     P.S. – If you need help working on gaining assets rather than working for the dollar, check out my survey. It will link you to your perfect teacher and/or coach based on your goals and interests. https://www.richdad.com/survey
